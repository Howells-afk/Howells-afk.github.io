    <h1>Pickleball: Rules and Strategy</h1>
    <h2>Rules of Pickleball</h2>
    <p>Pickleball is a relatively simple sport to learn, but it is important to know the rules of the game in order to play it correctly. Here are the basic rules of pickleball:</p>
    <ul>
		<li>The game is played on a court that is 20x44 feet (6.1x13.4 meters).</li>
		<li>The net is 36 inches (91.4 cm) high at the center and 34 inches (86.4 cm) high at the posts.</li>
		<li>The ball must be served diagonally, and it must land in the opponent's court.</li>
		<li>The ball can only be hit with the paddle one time before it must go over the net.</li>
		<li>If the ball lands out of bounds or hits a non-playable area, it is a fault.</li>
		<li>A point is scored when the opponent is unable to return the ball or hits the ball out of bounds. The first player or team to score 11 points and have a two-point lead wins the game.</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="text-align: center;">For a complete set of rules and regulations, you can refer to the official rulebook of the <a href="https://usapickleball.org/" target="_blank">USA Pickleball Association</a> website.	<a href="https://usapickleball.org/" target="_blank"> <img src="USAPA_Logo_Header.png" alt="Pickleball Image" width="75"	height="50"> </a></p>
